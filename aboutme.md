My name is Mihai. I'm interested in technology, and to some extent in `bite-size` **art/literature**. I'm interested about things that reveal the world in a different perspective. 

Nothing good comes out self-satisfaction/self-congratulation, and as such I strive to sharpen my technical skills.

### Technology

"My dear, here we must run as fast as we can, just to stay in place. And if you wish to go anywhere you must run twice as fast as that".  [Alice in Wonderland]

### Art | Intellectual pursuit

"Art is a call to a higher being. A piece of art itâ€™s a window into the transcendent."
