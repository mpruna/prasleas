### Statistics and Analytics basics (Under Construction)

**"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made."**

Before we learn how to run we must learn how to walk. There is no skipping fundamentals.

In this mini project I will explain a couple of statistics and analytics key concepts.  Everything starts with fundamentals. These concepts are key for more advanced Machine-Learning algorithms. 

A project must also have a natural flow to it. By this t I mean that each section must convey a clear answer and it must  natural lead to the next step.   

Choosing the appropriate plots or graphics is key to delivering a clear message.

At the most simplistic level the goal of an analysis is to provide an answer to a specific question.

Some graphs are better suited for particular scenarios then others.

Also data manipulation is necessary in some circumstances. Data might come in different formats and we must convert the data if we want to do forecast or model it.

Related to statistical math I will explain terms such as:

* populations and samples
* distributions
* mean | media | mode
* outliers

I will also dive a little bit into some data cleaning and manipulation techniques. And also I will show what and when should we choose a  specific type of plots.

### Fighter Dataset

### UFC Events Dataset

If we examine these 2 datasets we see that each row of data contains some properties.   
These properties having distinct values are called variables. Variables can either describe quantities of qualities.  
For instance the Instagram and Tweeter variable describe quantities. These columns describe  how much followers each fighter has.  
But Name, Nation, or Category describe a quality for each fighter. Variables that describe qualities are called qualitative or categorical variables.    
Qualitative or categorical variables don't have a direction, or in other words can't really tell if something is better then something else. For instance we can't say that as a name **Daniel Cormier** is better the **Derrick Lewis**.

### Nation and Category
